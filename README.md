#Simple personal site with Wordpress
I made this site to play a little with WP, some front end technologies and simple github actions to deploy.

The idea behind this is to have a working site in a few days with a nice development experience.

### Some extra info
Here you have only wp-content because the idea is to keep it simple and only version theme and plugins.

It's all developed locally with docker, and at the moment was a nice experience with the wordpress image.
